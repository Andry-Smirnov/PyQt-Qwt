# PyQt-Qwt
Python PyQt wrapper for Qwt6

The code is only tested for python3 and Qt5 but it
is written to work for python2/3 Qt4/5

The Qwt6 library must be patched with the patch
06_python_compat.patch in order to compile the code.
Hopefully there is some error in the python wrapper
that requires the patch.
